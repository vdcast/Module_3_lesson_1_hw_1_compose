**Lesson's topic:**

Database.

**Task:**

Create an organizer.
On the main screen - a list of tasks (each task has a topic, description, time, and the ability to make it important and it will be highlighted in the list in a different color).
You can create tasks, edit and delete them.
Cases are saved in the database, do not disappear when the application is launched again.

**Result: Screen recoding** (please, note that it was converted to GIF, so it's not smooth as it was):
